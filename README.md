# LoanLibrary
A Web-Application written in Javascript using Vue.js and Node.js as A project for the winter semester 22/23 at the RWU.

Graphical User Interfaces
=========================
As part of this lecture we are supposed to come up with an idea for a Web Application, which we will have to write using Java-Script and the two librarys Vue.js and Node.js specifically. A self-written backend is not required, since we are allowed to use [public-api](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). We have decided to Work on an online loan service that will loan out books, videos and games.

Project Structure
=================
We will try to avoid using JS, inside HTML. We will also try to seperate our Web-App in a frontend part and a backend part.
Inside the README we will have a section that describes what the specific files are supposed to do / manage.
